WHAT IS IT?
-------

https://launchpad.net/freevial

Freevial is an application developed by some members of Ubuntu' Catalan
LoCo Team (https://wiki.ubuntu.com/CatalanTeam) that can be used to play
a trivial-like game, looking like on a TV show, on community meetings. It is
thought to be used with a projector and loudspeakers.


INSTRUCTIONS
